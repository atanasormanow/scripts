- Abstract the choice and use some map for <choice, statement>
- Abstract running "alacritty -e <prog>" in a floating window of some size
  (or use --class and for_window)
- Close window after exiting nmtui
- Using dmenu_fancy works because it is in PATH (as are all scripts in this
  folder), but using ./dmenu_fancy does not work. Why??
